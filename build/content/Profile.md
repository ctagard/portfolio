I am Cole Agard, a dedicated Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for leveraging data-driven insights to create innovative solutions. As a UC Berkeley graduate, I hold a B.A. in Computer Science and am currently pursuing an M.S. in Data Science. My professional journey has been diverse, with internships at renowned organizations like OpenEye Scientific, Isomark LLC, and Los Alamos National Laboratory.

Throughout my career, I have developed a wide range of skills in programming languages, software engineering, data management, cloud technologies, and AI/ML libraries. My experience in both academia and industry has enabled me to work on high-impact projects and provide effective solutions to complex problems.

One of my proudest achievements is creating the Blacklight AutoML open-source library, a testament to my commitment to pushing the boundaries in machine learning and data science. As a result, I am a strong candidate for organizations seeking forward-thinking, results-driven professionals.

Outside of my professional life, I am an avid learner who enjoys staying current with the latest tech trends, exploring creative problem-solving techniques, and sharing my knowledge with others. My personal website serves as a platform to showcase my work, share my thoughts on emerging technologies, and connect with like-minded individuals in the field of data science and machine learning.
