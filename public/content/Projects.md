## Blacklight AutoML
Blacklight is a cutting-edge work-in-progress project which aims to revolutionize the field of AutoML by harnessing the power of genetic algorithms to optimize deep neural network (DNN) topologies. Blacklight's ambition extends beyond optimizing DNN topologies. Its overarching goal is to create a type-5 autoML framework capable of interviewing data scientists to gather vital information about their specific requirements. Leveraging the Blacklight library, this framework will then train a custom machine learning algorithm tailored to the data scientist's needs, ultimately deploying it through an easy-to-use API.

## Django Ecommerce Website
A full-stack ecommerce website built with Django, React, and Redux. The website features a fully functional shopping cart, product reviews, product ratings, product search, user profile with orders, admin product management, admin user management, and checkout process with Paypal and credit card payments which are not active as this is not a real business at the moment.
