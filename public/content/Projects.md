## Blacklight AutoML
Blacklight is a cutting-edge work-in-progress project, currently the subject of a Master's thesis in Data Science, which aims to revolutionize the field of AutoML by harnessing the power of genetic algorithms to optimize deep neural network (DNN) topologies. Blacklight's ambition extends beyond optimizing DNN topologies. Its overarching goal is to create a type-5 autoML framework capable of interviewing data scientists to gather vital information about their specific requirements. Leveraging the Blacklight library, this framework will then train a custom machine learning algorithm tailored to the data scientist's needs, ultimately deploying it through an easy-to-use API.
